# Privacy and Security Guide

This document outlines important privacy and security considerations for implementing and using the AI-HR-CV-Scan system. Following these guidelines will help ensure that candidate data is handled responsibly and in compliance with data protection regulations.

## Data Privacy Considerations

### Personal Data Handling

The AI-HR-CV-Scan system processes various types of personal data from candidates, including:

- Full names
- Contact information (phone numbers, email addresses)
- Location data
- Educational history
- Work experience
- Skills and qualifications

This information is considered personal data under many privacy regulations, including GDPR, CCPA, and other regional data protection laws.

### Legal Basis for Processing

Before implementing the system, ensure you have a valid legal basis for processing candidate data:

1. **Consent**: Inform candidates that their CVs will be processed by an automated system and obtain their consent.
2. **Legitimate Interest**: Document your legitimate interest assessment for using automated CV screening.
3. **Contractual Necessity**: If the processing is necessary as part of the application process.

### Privacy Notice

Create a clear privacy notice for candidates that includes:

1. What personal data is collected
2. How the data will be used
3. The automated processing involved
4. How long data will be retained
5. Candidate rights regarding their data
6. Contact information for data-related inquiries

### Data Retention

Implement appropriate data retention policies:

1. Define how long CV data will be stored in the system
2. Establish procedures for deleting data after the retention period
3. Consider anonymization for long-term talent pool storage
4. Document your retention policy and justification

## Security Measures

### Access Control

Restrict access to the system and candidate data:

1. **n8n Access**: Limit access to the n8n workflow to authorized HR personnel only
2. **Google Drive**: Restrict access to CV folders to necessary personnel
3. **Google Sheet**: Implement appropriate sharing settings for the data sheet
4. **API Credentials**: Secure all API keys and credentials

### Credential Security

Protect all credentials used in the system:

1. **Google OAuth**: Secure storage of OAuth credentials
2. **OCR.space API Key**: Protect the API key from unauthorized access
3. **n8n Credentials**: Use n8n's secure credential storage
4. **Regular Rotation**: Periodically rotate credentials and API keys

### Data Transmission

Ensure secure data transmission:

1. **HTTPS**: Use secure connections for all API communications
2. **OAuth 2.0**: Implement proper OAuth flows for Google services
3. **Minimal Data Transfer**: Only transmit necessary data between services

### Data Storage

Secure the storage of candidate data:

1. **Google Drive Security**: Leverage Google's security features for file storage
2. **Google Sheets Protection**: Use sheet protection features to prevent unauthorized edits
3. **Backup Security**: Ensure any backups are also properly secured

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR Compliance (European Union)

If processing data of EU residents:

1. **Data Subject Rights**: Implement processes for handling:
   - Right to access
   - Right to rectification
   - Right to erasure
   - Right to restrict processing
   - Right to data portability
   - Right to object

2. **Automated Decision-Making**: The system involves automated evaluation, so:
   - Inform candidates about the logic involved
   - Ensure human review of significant decisions
   - Allow candidates to contest automated evaluations

3. **Data Protection Impact Assessment**: Consider conducting a DPIA for the system

### Other Regional Regulations

Adapt the implementation to comply with relevant local regulations:

1. **CCPA/CPRA** (California)
2. **LGPD** (Brazil)
3. **POPIA** (South Africa)
4. **PIPL** (China)
5. Other applicable national or regional data protection laws

## Ethical AI Use

### Bias Mitigation

Take steps to minimize bias in the AI evaluation:

1. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review evaluation results for patterns of bias
2. **Diverse Training Data**: Ensure the AI has been trained on diverse examples
3. **Balanced Prompts**: Craft AI prompts that encourage fair evaluation
4. **Human Oversight**: Always have human review of AI evaluations

### Transparency

Maintain transparency in the AI evaluation process:

1. **Explainable Results**: Ensure evaluation results include explanations
2. **Candidate Awareness**: Inform candidates about AI use in the screening process
3. **Internal Documentation**: Document how the AI makes evaluations

## Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist when implementing the system:

### Before Implementation

- [ ] Conduct a data protection impact assessment (if applicable)
- [ ] Create a privacy notice for candidates
- [ ] Establish data retention policies
- [ ] Document the legal basis for processing
- [ ] Review and secure all API credentials

- [ ] Monitor for potential bias in evaluations
- [ ] Maintain records of processing activities
- [ ] Ensure human oversight of significant decisions
- [ ] Regularly review and rotate credentials

### Data Breach Response

Prepare a response plan in case of a data breach:

1. **Detection**: Methods to detect potential breaches
2. **Containment**: Steps to contain any identified breach
3. **Assessment**: Process to assess the impact and scope
4. **Notification**: Procedures for notifying affected individuals and authorities
5. **Recovery**: Plan for system recovery and security improvements

## Third-Party Services

### OCR.space

When using OCR.space for text extraction:

1. Review their privacy policy and terms of service
2. Understand how they process and store document data
3. Consider data residency implications

### Google Services

When using Google Drive and Sheets:

1. Configure appropriate sharing and access settings
2. Understand Google's data processing terms
3. Consider data residency and transfer implications

## Conclusion

Implementing proper privacy and security measures is essential when using the AI-HR-CV-Scan system. By following these guidelines, you can help ensure that candidate data is protected, regulatory requirements are met, and the system is used ethically and responsibly.

Remember that this document provides general guidance and should be adapted to your specific organizational needs and the legal requirements of your jurisdiction. Consider consulting with privacy and legal experts when implementing the system.
